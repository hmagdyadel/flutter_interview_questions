## Flutter Fundamentals

### Why did you choose to learn Flutter?
Flutter allows building cross-platform applications (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) using a single codebase. It offers:
- Professional UI control with custom widgets
- Fast development with Hot Reload
- Time savings across multiple platforms
- High performance with native compilation

### What makes Flutter fast and secure?

**Speed:**
- Uses lightweight, efficient widgets
- Direct compilation to native code (no bridge overhead)
- Single codebase combining UI and logic
- Impeller rendering engine for smooth, precompiled rendering
- Skia graphics engine for consistent performance

**Security:**
- Null Safety prevents null reference errors at compile-time
- Secure networking via HTTPS and certificate pinning
- Secure storage solutions for sensitive data
- Isolates for secure background task execution
- Granular permission management

### How does Flutter manage performance? (JIT vs AOT)
- **Development**: Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation for fast iterations and Hot Reload
- **Release**: Uses AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation to compile Dart to native machine code, ensuring optimal runtime performance

### Is Flutter suitable for high-performance applications?
Yes. Flutter renders UI directly using its own rendering engine (Skia/Impeller) without relying on platform-specific UI components. This makes it suitable for:
- High-performance applications
- Games and animation-heavy apps
- 60fps smooth animations
- Complex UI interactions

## Dart Language & OOP Concepts

### What are the four pillars of OOP?

**1. Encapsulation**
- Hiding internal class details and restricting direct access
- Data is exposed only through controlled interfaces (getters/setters)

**2. Abstraction**
- Focusing on essential features while hiding implementation details
- Allows defining common behavior that can be implemented differently by subclasses

**3. Inheritance**
- Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- Promotes code reuse and better organization

**4. Polymorphism**
- One interface can have multiple implementations
- Behavior changes dynamically based on the object type or context

### How is polymorphism implemented in Flutter?
Polymorphism in Flutter is achieved through:
- **Inheritance and interfaces**: Different widget types implementing common interfaces
- **Method overriding**: Subclasses providing specific implementations
- **Callbacks and function types**: Dynamic behavior based on passed functions
- **Widget polymorphism**: Same widget behaving differently based on state or context

### How does Dart handle multiple inheritance?
Dart doesn't support multiple inheritance directly to avoid complexity. Instead, it uses:
- **Mixins**: Add behavior from multiple sources using the `with` keyword
- **Interfaces**: Implement multiple contracts using the `implements` keyword
- **Composition**: Combine functionality through object composition

### What's the difference between an interface and a mixin in Dart?

**Interface:**
- Any class can act as an interface
- Implemented using the `implements` keyword
- Requires overriding all methods defined in the interface
- Dart 3.0 introduced the `interface` keyword for clarity
- Cannot inherit implementation, only contracts

**Mixin:**
- Used to share code across multiple classes without inheritance
- Added using the `with` keyword
- Provides actual implementation, not just contracts
- Ideal for adding common behaviors to multiple classes
- Can contain both abstract and concrete methods

### What's the difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism in Dart?

**Compile-time Polymorphism:**
- Resolved during compilation
- Achieved through method overloading (using optional/named parameters in Dart)
- Type-based resolution

**Run-time Polymorphism:**
- Resolved during execution
- Achieved through method overriding and inheritance
- Dynamic method dispatch based on actual object type

### Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming

**Functional Programming (FP):**
- Focuses on pure functions and immutability
- Functions are first-class citizens
- No side effects, predictable behavior
- Used in Flutter for: stateless widgets, data transformations, state management

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
- Focuses on objects and encapsulation
- Mutable state and behavior modeling
- Inheritance and polymorphism

**Benefits of FP:**
- Cleaner, more testable code
- Predictable behavior with fewer bugs
- Better parallelization and concurrency

**Disadvantages of FP:**
- Steeper learning curve for OOP developers
- Can be less intuitive for modeling complex systems
- Performance overhead with immutable data structures

---

## Widgets & UI

### What is the difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets?

**StatelessWidget:**
- Does not hold any mutable state
- Immutable after creation
- Used for static UI components
- Examples: Text, Icon, Container
- Better performance due to fewer rebuilds

**StatefulWidget:**
- Maintains mutable state that can change over time
- Can trigger rebuilds when state changes
- Used for dynamic UI components
- Examples: Forms, animations, interactive elements
- Requires State object to manage lifecycle

### When to use Keys in Widgets?
Keys help Flutter:
- Identify widgets that have moved in the widget tree
- Preserve widget state during rebuilds
- Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary widget recreation
- Maintain scroll position and form input state

**Types of Keys:**
- `ValueKey`: Based on a value
- `ObjectKey`: Based on object identity
- `UniqueKey`: Always unique
- `GlobalKey`: Access widget from anywhere in the app

### What is the Widget Lifecycle?

**StatefulWidget Lifecycle:**
1. `createState()`: Creates the State object
2. `initState()`: Called once when widget is inserted into tree
3. `didChangeDependencies()`: Called when dependencies change
4. `build()`: Called whenever UI needs to be rebuilt
5. `didUpdateWidget()`: Called when widget configuration changes
6. `deactivate()`: Called when widget is removed from tree temporarily
7. `dispose()`: Called when widget is permanently removed

**Why it's important:**
- Manage resources (controllers, subscriptions)
- Handle API calls and data loading
- Optimize performance and prevent memory leaks

### What is BuildContext?
BuildContext is a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree. It provides access to:
- Theme data
- Localization
- MediaQuery (screen size, orientation)
- Navigation
- Inherited widgets
- ScaffoldMessenger for snackbars

### Cross-Device UI Compatibility
**Responsive Design Techniques:**
- Use `MediaQuery` for screen dimensions
- Implement `LayoutBuilder` for constraint-based layouts
- Use `Flexible` and `Expanded` for adaptive layouts
- Define custom breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Implement `SafeArea` for notches and system UI
- Ensure proper accessibility with semantic labels
- Test on various devices and orientations

## State Management

### Why is state management important in Flutter?
State management is crucial because:
- State drives UI behavior based on data and user interactions
- Without proper structure, UI updates become hard to maintain and scale
- Ensures consistent data flow throughout the application
- Enables predictable and testable application behavior

### State Management Solutions Comparison

**Provider:**
- Simple and lightweight
- Good for small to medium applications
- Uses InheritedWidget under the hood
- Easy learning curve

**Riverpod:**
- Evolution of Provider with improved API
- No BuildContext dependency
- Better testing support
- Compile-time safety
- Supports auto-disposal

**BLoC (Business Logic Component):**
- Stream-based architecture
- Excellent for large, complex applications
- Predictable state changes through events
- Great testing support
- More boilerplate code

**GetX:**
- All-in-one solution (state management, routing, dependency injection)
- Minimal boilerplate
- Can break clean architecture principles
- Performance optimized

### BLoC vs Riverpod

**BLoC:**
- Uses Streams for state management
- Event-driven architecture (Events â†’ States)
- More boilerplate but better for complex state transitions
- Excellent for large applications

**Riverpod:**
- Provider-based but stateless
- Independent of BuildContext
- Cleaner syntax and better developer experience
- Ideal for modern apps requiring modularity

### BLoC vs Cubit

**BLoC:**
- Uses Events and States
- More explicit state transitions
- Better for complex business logic
- More boilerplate code

**Cubit:**
- Simplified version of BLoC
- Uses only States (no Events)
- Direct method calls to change state
- Less boilerplate, easier to implement

### BLoC Structure
- **Event**: Represents user actions or triggers (button tap, data load)
- **State**: Represents the current state of the UI
- **BLoC**: Logic unit that maps events to states using Streams
- **Repository**: Data layer that BLoC interacts with

---

## Asynchronous Programming

### Future vs Stream - What's the difference?

**Future:**
- Represents a single asynchronous operation
- Completes once with either a value or an error
- Think of it as a "promise" for one result
- Used for: API calls, file operations, database queries

**Stream:**
- Represents a sequence of asynchronous events over time
- Can emit multiple values, errors, or completion signals
- Continuous flow of data
- Used for: real-time updates, user input events, WebSocket connections

### Can a Stream have multiple subscribers?

**Single-subscription Stream:**
- Only one listener can subscribe
- Suitable for one-time or isolated data operations
- Created with `StreamController()` or async generators

**Broadcast Stream:**
- Allows multiple listeners
- Ideal for shared data sources like live updates
- Created with `StreamController.broadcast()`
- **Note**: Late subscribers won't receive already emitted data

**Managing Multiple Subscribers:**
```dart
// Convert single-subscription to broadcast
Stream<int> singleStream = getSingleStream();
Stream<int> broadcastStream = singleStream.asBroadcastStream();

// Multiple listeners
broadcastStream.listen((data) => print('Listener 1: $data'));
broadcastStream.listen((data) => print('Listener 2: $data'));
```

## Data Storage & Caching

### Storage Solutions Comparison

**SharedPreferences:**
- Stores small, simple data (strings, booleans, integers)
- Key-value based storage
- No encryption
- Perfect for: user preferences, settings, flags

**Flutter Secure Storage:**
- Similar to SharedPreferences but with encryption
- Used for sensitive data (API tokens, credentials)
- Platform-specific secure storage (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android)

**Hive:**
- Fast, lightweight NoSQL database
- Great for medium to complex data (objects, JSON)
- No SQL required
- Supports encryption
- Type-safe with code generation

**Sqflite:**
- SQLite database for Flutter
- Ideal for large, structured, relational data
- Requires SQL knowledge
- Great for complex relationships and queries

### Best Practices for Caching Data

**Choose the Right Solution:**
- Small data (tokens, settings): SharedPreferences/Secure Storage
- Complex data (JSON, lists): Hive or Sqflite
- Large files: File system with path_provider

**Architecture:**
- Handle caching in Repository layer
- Avoid caching logic inside widgets
- Implement cache-first or network-first strategies

**Cache Management:**
- Set expiration times for automatic refresh
- Implement periodic cleanup to save space
- Use cache keys consistently
- Handle cache invalidation properly

### How to Check if Cached Data is Outdated

**Timestamp-based Expiration:**
```dart
class CacheEntry<T> {
  final T data;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final Duration validDuration;
  
  bool get isExpired => 
    DateTime.now().difference(timestamp) > validDuration;
}
```

**Version-based Invalidation:**
- Store version numbers with cached data
- Compare with server version to determine freshness
- Use ETags for HTTP-based caching

**Lightweight API Checks:**
- Make HEAD requests to check if data changed
- Use last-modified headers
- Implement cache validation endpoints

### Managing Large Files (10GB example)

**Chunking Strategy:**
```dart
// Split file into manageable chunks
const chunkSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB chunks
for (int i = 0; i < totalChunks; i++) {
  await downloadChunk(i, chunkSize);
}
```

**Storage Management:**
- Use `path_provider` for appropriate directories
- Check available storage before download
- Implement pause/resume functionality
- Clean up temporary files

**Memory Optimization:**
- Stream file operations to avoid loading entire file in memory
- Use `RandomAccessFile` for large file operations
- Implement progress tracking and error recovery
